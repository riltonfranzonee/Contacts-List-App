# Contacts List 

This is a react native app of a simple contacts list made through Harvard's CS50 course, where the user can only add a new contact if the number input has 10 numbers and the contact name has more than 3 letters. In this project you can see some features like:

* Random contacts generator
* Section Lists 
* Sort the contacts by alphabetical order
* Add contacts form
* Input validation
